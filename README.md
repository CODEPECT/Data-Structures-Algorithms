## Introduction
Data structures and algorithms form the fundamental building blocks of computer science. Understanding and applying these concepts is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently.

## Big O Notation
Big O notation is used to describe the performance and complexity of algorithms. It provides insights into the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements.

Examples:
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time

## Data Structures
### Arrays
- **Definition**: A collection of elements identified by their index.
- **Operations**: Access, insertion, deletion, traversal.

### Linked Lists
- **Definition**: A linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers.
- **Types**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.

### Stacks
- **Definition**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Push, pop, peek.

### Queues
- **Definition**: A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Types**: Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue.

### Trees
- **Definition**: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes.
- **Types**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree.

### Heaps
- **Definition**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Types**: Max heap, min heap.

### Graphs
- **Definition**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
- **Types**: Directed graph, undirected graph, weighted graph.

### Hash Tables
- **Definition**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs.
- **Operations**: Insert, delete, search.

## Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Dynamic Programming
- **Concept**: Solving problems by breaking them down into subproblems and storing the results.
- **Examples**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem.

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Concept**: Making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
- **Examples**: Dijkstra's algorithm, Huffman coding.

### Backtracking
- **Concept**: Trying out all possibilities to find a solution.
- **Examples**: N-Queens problem, sudoku solver.

### Divide and Conquer
- **Concept**: Breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem, and combining the solutions.
- **Examples**: Merge sort, quick sort.
